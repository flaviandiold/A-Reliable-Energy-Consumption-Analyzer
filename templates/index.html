		<p class ="col l1 s12">Power Consumption Analysis for Household Appliances, is a project that allows the customers to analyse and predict the energy consumption patterns of their appliances, with 
which they will be able to understand the amount of power each appliance is draining and 
with respect to that the customer would be able to understand each appliance usage, and
the respective charges for them, which proves to be advantageous as when one knows the 
area of heavy consumption, the customer would be able to reduce it drastically.
The project provides the customer with rich and refined data reflecting on the energy 
consumption of the household appliances. With the data collected from the user, the 
trained model is capable enough to analyse the power consumption of the meters 
associated with the appliances, with which the user will be able to understand the electricity 
consumption. Electricity being an important aspect of everybodyâ€™s personal life, this project 
holds utmost importance in everyday life. </p>
